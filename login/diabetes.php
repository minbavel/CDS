    <p>The Disease Might Be <b>DIABETES!!</b></p>
    <p><h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Diabetes is a chronic disease that can affect dogs and cats and other animals (including apes, pigs, and horses) as well as humans. Although diabetes can’t be cured, it can be managed very successfully.</p>
<p><h3>The glucose–insulin connection</h3><br>

The conversion of food nutrients into energy to power the body’s cells involves an ongoing interplay of two things:<br>

• Glucose: essential fuel for the body’s cells. When food is digested, the body breaks down some of the nutrients into glucose, a type of sugar that is a vital source of energy for certain body cells and organs. The glucose is absorbed from the intestines into the blood, which then transports the glucose throughout the body.<br>

• Insulin: in charge of fuel delivery. Meanwhile, an important organ next to the stomach called the pancreas releases the hormone insulin into the body. Insulin acts as a “gatekeeper” that tells cells to grab glucose and other nutrients out of the bloodstream and use them as fuel.<br> </p>
    <p><h3>What is diabetes?</h3><br>

With diabetes, the glucose-insulin connection isn’t working as it should. Diabetes occurs in dogs in two forms:<br>

• Insulin-deficiency diabetes—This is when the dog’s body isn’t producing enough insulin. This happens when the pancreas is damaged or otherwise not functioning properly. Dogs with this type of diabetes need daily shots to replace the missing insulin. This is the most common type of diabetes in dogs.<br>

• Insulin-resistance diabetes—This is when the pancreas is producing some insulin, but the dog’s body isn’t utilizing the insulin as it should. The cells aren’t responding to the insulin’s “message,” so glucose isn’t being pulled out of the blood and into the cells. This type of diabetes can especially occur in older, obese dogs.<br>

Female dogs can also develop temporary insulin resistance while in heat or pregnant.<br>

Damage caused by diabetes: A double whammy<br>

Whatever the type of diabetes, the negative effects on the body are the same. Excessive sugar builds up in the dog’s bloodstream, and yet the body’s cells that need that sugar can’t access it.<br>

So the “bad” effects that diabetes causes in the dog’s body are twofold:<br>

• Cells are starved for vital “fuel.” Muscle cells and certain organ cells are deprived of the glucose “fuel” they need for energy. In response, the body starts breaking down its own fats and proteins to use as alternative fuel.<br>

    • High sugar level in the bloodstream damages many organs. Without insulin to help convert the glucose in the bloodstream into fuel, high levels of glucose build up in the blood. Unfortunately, this abnormal blood chemistry acts like a sort of poison and eventually causes multi-organ damage. This often includes damage to the kidneys, eyes, heart, blood vessels, or nerves.<br></p>
    
<p><h3>Symptoms</h3>

Early signs. The owner will sometimes notice certain symptoms that can be early signs of diabetes:<br>

    <b>Excessive thirst</b>. The dog may drink frequently and empty the water bowl more often.<br>
   <b>Increased urination</b>. The dog may ask to go outside frequently and may start having “accidents” in the house. Increased urination (and increased thirst) happens because the body is trying to get rid of excess sugar by sending it out through urine, along with water that bonds to the sugar.<br>
    <b>Weight loss</b>. The dog can lose weight despite eating normal portions. This is because the dog isn’t efficiently converting nutrients from its food.<br>
    <b>Increased appetite</b>. The dog can be very hungry all the time because the body’s cells aren’t getting all the glucose they need, even though the dog is eating a normal amount.<br></p>
