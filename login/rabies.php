    <p>The Disease Might Be <b>RABIES!!</b></p>
    <p><h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Rabies is a deadly virus spread to people from the saliva of infected animals. The rabies virus is usually transmitted through a bite.</p>

<p>Animals most likely to transmit rabies in the United States include bats, coyotes, foxes, raccoons and skunks. In developing countries of Africa and Southeast Asia, stray dogs are the most likely to spread rabies to people.</p>

   <p> Once a person begins showing signs and symptoms of rabies, the disease is nearly always fatal. For this reason, anyone who may have a risk of contracting rabies should receive rabies vaccines for protection.</p>

<h3>Symptoms</h3>
<p>The first symptoms of rabies may be very similar to the flu and may last for days. Later signs and symptoms may include:</p>

<p>Fever<br>
Headache<br>
Nausea<br>
Vomiting<br>
Agitation<br>
Anxiety<br>
Confusion<br>
Hyperactivity<br>
Difficulty swallowing<br>
Excessive salivation<br>
Fear of water (hydrophobia) because of the difficulty in swallowing<br>
Hallucinations<br>
Insomnia<br>
    Partial paralysis<br></p>
    <p><h3>When to see a doctor</h3></p>
<p>Seek immediate medical care if you're bitten by any animal, or exposed to an animal suspected of having rabies. Based on your injuries and the situation in which the exposure occurred, you and your doctor can decide whether you should receive treatment to prevent rabies.</p>

<p>Even if you aren't sure whether you've been bitten, seek medical attention. For instance, a bat that flies into your room while you're sleeping may bite you without waking you. If you awake to find a bat in your room, assume you've been bitten. Also, if you find a bat near a person who can't report a bite, such as a small child or a person with a disability, assume that person has been bitten.</p>
